# Retro Audio Visualizer

A web application that visualizes audio with a retro aesthetic style. This project consists of a React frontend and Node.js backend.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: React application for the user interface and visualization
- `backend/`: Node.js server handling audio processing

## Getting Started

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```

## Development

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the frontend. You may see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```
cd frontend
npm run build
```

This builds the app to the `build` folder, optimizing the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```
cd frontend
npm test
```

This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
